It's been quite some time from my side on the blog.

But I wasn't quite at all. I've had nice conversations with a few of you.

I've did some other things myself. I didn't knew which direction we needed to take with the Mr Frontend Community.

But I think I found a way, I guess!

I saw that a few of you needed more motivation talking than technical blogposts. So I've listend to the message you all send to me!

That's why today I took the leap of faith and recorded the first episode of "Mr Frontend Motivation Talk". That was the first step and I have plenty to record!

If you have topic requests for the next episodes, please put them in the comments! I would be very happy to help you stay motivated in becoming a better developer.

Enjoy!
