Are you dealing with FOMO when seeing all these new frameworks popping up all the time? For some it’s more than for others!

In this story I want to tell you that it’s not needed 😉 to fear your missing something by jumping on every new framework: [_https://medium.com/undefined-developer/do-you-fear-missing-the-train-of-the-next-framework-d8dc525efe1a_](https://medium.com/undefined-developer/do-you-fear-missing-the-train-of-the-next-framework-d8dc525efe1a)

The war inside the JavaScript community doesn’t make any sense to me. It’s running for many years and people are fighting which one is the best.

But if you joined the war and picked one of the frameworks as your weapons, you’re picking the wrong side:  [_https://medium.com/undefined-developer/you-picked-the-wrong-side-of-the-javascript-war-583e64fe9c74_](https://medium.com/undefined-developer/you-picked-the-wrong-side-of-the-javascript-war-583e64fe9c74)
