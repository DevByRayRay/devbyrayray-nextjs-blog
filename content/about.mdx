## About RayRay

Hi,

I'm Ray, and I've been working as a developer since 2009.

Senior Frontend Developer from the Netherlands. I love writing about CSS, JavaScript, NextJS, Angular, Serverless functions, Netlify, and a lot more related to Frontend Development.

I'm super passionate about helping others with getting better in Frontend Development. Allowing them to get better tech & soft skills to rock it on their job/project.
